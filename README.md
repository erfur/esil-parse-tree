# ESIL parse tree

A little unfinished project I did in my free time to try and utilize ESIL somehow. It's pretty useless at the moment, maybe after including z3 and branch handling it might become a generic deobfuscation helper.

# TODO

- [ ] Implement ESIL semantics
- [ ] Integrate Z3 and simple simplifications
- [ ] Implement tree visualization
- [ ] Branch handling?
